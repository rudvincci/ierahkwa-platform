#### Post 7: Blockchain in Banking

**LinkedIn**:
```
⛓️ Blockchain in Banking: Beyond the Hype

Most blockchains are too slow for banking (15-30 TPS). MameyNode achieves 24,356+ TPS with < 50ms latency.

But performance alone isn't enough. Banking requires:
✅ Complete banking operations (not just payments)
✅ Built-in compliance (AML/CFT, KYC)
✅ Regulatory reporting
✅ Integration with existing systems

MameyNode delivers all of this—production-ready, proven, transformative.

### Thought Leadership Posts

#### Post 8: The Future of Banking

**LinkedIn**:
```
🔮 The Future of Banking Infrastructure

Traditional banking infrastructure is fragmented, expensive, and slow. The future is unified, affordable, and fast.

The Mamey ecosystem represents this future:
• Unified platform (not fragmented systems)
• 10-50x more affordable (not expensive licensing)
• 1000x faster (not days, but milliseconds)
• Complete control (not vendor lock-in)

The question isn't whether banking will transform—it's who will lead that transformation.

We believe that's us.

• Unified infrastructure (not point solutions)
• Complete control (not vendor dependency)
