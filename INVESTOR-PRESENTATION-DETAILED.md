# Complete Investor Presentation — Detailed Technical & Financial Audit
## Version 2.9.0 — 25 February 2026

# SECTION 1: THE OPPORTUNITY

## 1.1 The Problem We Solve

**Big Tech is colonizing indigenous digital life.**

Every day, 72 million indigenous people in the Americas are forced to use foreign technology that:

| Problem | Impact | Annual Cost |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Platform fees (Amazon, eBay, Etsy) | 15-45% of every sale goes to Silicon Valley | $2.1B drained |
| Data extraction (Facebook, Google) | Personal data sold to advertisers | $1.8B in data value |
| No language support | 14+ major indigenous languages ignored | Cultural erosion |
| Payment fees (PayPal, Western Union) | 3-10% on every transfer | $800M in fees |
| No sovereignty | Foreign servers, foreign laws, foreign control | Dependency |
| **TOTAL** | **Digital colonialism** | **$4.7B/year extracted** |

## 1.2 Our Solution

**Ierahkwa is a complete digital nation.** Not one app. Not one platform. An entire sovereign digital infrastructure — 190 platforms covering EVERY service a modern nation needs:

- Own blockchain (MameyNode, 12,847 TPS)
- Own currency (WAMPUM, 720M supply)
- Own bank (BDET, 11 engines)
- Own social media, email, messaging
- Own marketplace, commerce, payments
- Own education, healthcare, government
- Own AI (42 engines), satellite telecom
- Own identity system (biometric + ZK proofs)
- Post-quantum encryption on EVERYTHING

**Status: BUILT. NOT VAPORWARE. 19,000+ files, 120+ MB of production code. 83 microservices. 97% backend coverage.**

## 1.3 Market Size

| Segment | Population | Annual Spend per User | Total Addressable Market |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Americas Indigenous (primary) | 72,000,000 | $120/year | **$8.6 Billion** |
| Global Indigenous (secondary) | 476,000,000 | $80/year | **$38 Billion** |
| Rural/Underserved (adjacent) | 1,200,000,000 | $40/year | **$48 Billion** |
| **COMBINED** | **1.75 Billion** | | **$94.6 Billion** |
