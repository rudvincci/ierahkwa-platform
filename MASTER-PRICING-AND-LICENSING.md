# SECTION 10: HOW THE PRICING ENGINE WORKS

## 10.1 Technical Architecture

Every microservice enforces tier access through middleware:

```
User Request → API Gateway → Auth Middleware → Tier Check → Service
                                  ↓
                            FWID + TenantId
                                  ↓
                         Tier: Member/Resident/Citizen
                                  ↓
                         Feature flags per tier
```

## 10.2 Multi-Tenancy (White-Label)

```
Tenant A (Navajo Nation)  →  TenantId: "navajo"  →  Isolated data
Tenant B (COICA)          →  TenantId: "coica"   →  Isolated data
Tenant C (Mapuche)        →  TenantId: "mapuche"  →  Isolated data
```

Every entity in every microservice has:
- `TenantId` — isolates data per white-label deployment
- `CreatedBy` — audit trail for user actions
- `IsActive` — soft-delete (never lose data)

## 10.3 Pricing Configuration

Each platform's tier access is configured via a central pricing service:

```json
{
  "platform": "telemedicina-soberana",
  "nexus": "URBE",
  "tiers": {
    "member": { "access": "info_only", "features": ["view_articles"] },
    "resident": { "access": "full", "features": ["consults", "prescriptions", "lab_results"], "limit": "3_sessions_month" },
    "citizen": { "access": "unlimited", "features": ["*"], "limit": "none" }
  }
}
```

# SECTION 11: FISCAL TRANSPARENCY

All revenue and spending is tracked on the MameyNode blockchain:

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Every transaction | Recorded on-chain with tx hash |
| Fiscal allocation | Smart contract auto-distributes 25% to sovereign fund |
| Government spending | Visible on auditoria-soberana and fiscal-transparency platforms |
| WAMPUM burn | 0.1% of every transfer is burned (deflationary) |
| Audit trail | Every microservice logs to AuditTrail service |
| Public dashboard | Real-time revenue/spending at fiscal-dashboard |

# SECTION 13: EXIT STRATEGY

**There is no exit.**

Ierahkwa is not built to be sold to Google or acquired by Amazon. That would defeat the purpose.

**Ierahkwa is built to be permanent sovereign infrastructure** — like roads, bridges, and power grids. It is owned by the indigenous nations it serves.

**The "exit" is sovereignty.**

When 72 million indigenous people control their own digital infrastructure, their own data, their own currency, their own banking, their own education, their own healthcare, their own communications — that is the exit.

**Investor returns come from:**
1. Revenue sharing (transaction fees, subscriptions)
2. White-label licensing growth
3. Sovereign bond issuance (backed by WAMPUM reserves)
4. Secondary market for WAMPUM tokens
