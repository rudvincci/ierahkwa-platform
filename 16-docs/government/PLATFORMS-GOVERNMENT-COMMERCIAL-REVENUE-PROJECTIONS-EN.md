**Total standalone services:** 62. **Sum of annual prices (if each sold once):** ~**120,000+ USD/year** per full catalog per customer segment. In practice, revenue is a mix of subscriptions (recurring), transaction fees (trading, gaming GGR), and one-time fees (listing, setup). Citizen discount: 15% (pricing rules).

---

## 4. Market values and current revenue/cost (base year 2026)

| Item | Value or amount (USD) | Source / note |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
| Ecosystem value (IGT + infra + BDET + CryptoHost + Trading + Casino + AI/Quantum + 40 depts) | 5.45 T | Executive report / valor report |
| Bank reserves (gold, USD, EUR, BTC, ETH, bonds, real estate, IGT) | 331.7 B | BDET |
| Trading volume 24h | 18 B | Exchange |
| GGR Casino (annual) | 6 B | Gaming |
| Revenue comercial anual (base) | 18 B | Trading fees, Casino GGR, Banking, CryptoHost, Social ads, Gov services, Staking, Listing, Token sales |
| OPEX comercial (sin gobierno) | 8.24 B | Bank, Casino, Social, Exchange, CryptoHost, AI, Quantum, Nodes, Security, Marketing, R&D |
| EBITDA comercial | 9.76 B | Revenue − OPEX comercial |
| EBITDA margin | 54.2% | |
| Government OPEX (40 departments) | 679.45 B | Budget; separate from commercial P&L |
| Social users (reference) | 250 M | For per-user revenue scaling |

---

## 5. Rentability and profitability (commercial)

| Segment | Revenue driver | Typical margin / rentability |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Subscription services (Telecom, Security, AI, Quantum, SaaS) | Monthly fee per user/org | High; recurring; 60–80% gross margin possible |
| Trading (TradeX, Forex, Mamey Futures) | Fees (maker/taker), spread | Volume-dependent; 50–70% margin on fees |
| Casino / Gaming | GGR (house edge), rake | 80%+ of GGR after payouts; very high rentability |
| Banking (BDET, APIs) | Spread, fees, interest | Regulated; stable margins |
| CryptoHost / DeFi | Hosting fee, conversion spread, staking commission | 50–70% |
| Social (ads, premium) | Ads, subscriptions, tips | Variable; scale-driven |
| Government services (licenses, permits, fines) | Fees, fines | Cost recovery + margin where set |

**Blended revenue per active citizen (reference):** 18 B / 250 M ≈ **72 USD/year** (subscription + transaction + gaming share combined). For “1 to all Americas” we use this as a base and scale.

---

## 6. Revenue and profit from 1 citizen to all citizens of the Americas

**Assumptions:**  
- Blended revenue per active citizen/year: **72 USD** (base).  
- At scale, blended cost per citizen (platform, support, infra) is lower; **EBITDA margin** kept in range **50–55%** for projection.  
- “Citizens” = active users (accounts) generating revenue (subscription, transactions, or gaming).  
- Americas population (reference): **~1,000 million** (North + Central + South + Caribbean).  
- Growth: revenue and citizens scale together; margin stable.

### 6.1 Revenue and profit by number of citizens (single year, same logic for any year)

| Citizens (active) | Revenue (USD/year) | EBITDA (55%) (USD/year) |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | 72 | 40 |
| 1,000 | 72,000 | 39,600 |
| 10,000 | 720,000 | 396,000 |
| 100,000 | 7,200,000 | 3,960,000 |
| 1,000,000 | 72,000,000 | 39,600,000 |
| 10,000,000 | 720,000,000 | 396,000,000 |
| 50,000,000 | 3,600,000,000 | 1,980,000,000 |
| 100,000,000 | 7,200,000,000 | 3,960,000,000 |
| 250,000,000 | 18,000,000,000 | 9,900,000,000 |
| 500,000,000 | 36,000,000,000 | 19,800,000,000 |
| 1,000,000,000 (all Americas) | 72,000,000,000 | 39,600,000,000 |

So: **from 1 citizen to all citizens of the Americas, total commercial revenue would range from 72 USD/year to 72 B USD/year**, and **profit (EBITDA) from ~40 USD to 39.6 B USD/year**, with the same per-citizen economics.

---

## 7. Multi-year profit and revenue projections (tables)

**Growth assumptions (annual):**  
- Revenue: **14%**

| 2029 | 26.67 B | 411 | 14.67 B |
| 2030 | 30.40 B | 485 | 16.72 B |
| 2031 | 34.66 B | 572 | 19.06 B |

### 7.2 10-year table (2026–2036)

| Year | Revenue (USD) | Active citizens (M) | EBITDA (55%) (USD) |

| 2032 | 39.52 B | 676 | 21.74 B |
| 2034 | 51.38 B | 942 | 28.26 B |
| 2036 | 66.73 B | 1,308 | 36.70 B |

### 7.3 20-year table (2026–2046)

| Year | Revenue (USD) | Active citizens (M) | EBITDA (55%) (USD) |
|------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 2026 | 18.00 B | 250 | 9.90 B |
| 2031 | 34.66 B | 572 | 19.06 B |
| 2036 | 66.73 B | 1,308 | 36.70 B |
| 2041 | 128.4 B | 2,875 | 70.6 B |
| 2046 | 247.2 B | 6,320 | 136.0 B |

(Revenue and citizens compound at 14% and 18% respectively; EBITDA = 55% of revenue.)

## 8. Ecosystem value projection (multi-year)

Using **12% annual growth** in ecosystem value (from valor report):

| Year | Ecosystem value (USD) |
|------|------------------------|
| 2026 | 5.45 T |
| 2030 | 8.60 T |
| 2035 | 15.2 T |
| 2040 | 26.8 T |
| 2045 | 47.2 T |
| 2050 | 83.2 T |

## 9. Products and capabilities that nobody else has

The following products or capabilities exist in the Ierahkwa sovereign ecosystem and **no other sovereign or commercial provider has the same combination** in one stack:

| # | Product / capability | Why nobody else has it |
|---|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **BDET Central Bank + 4 regional central banks + IGT** | No other Indigenous Americas sovereign has a full central bank, four regional central banks, and sovereign currency (IGT) issuance in one integrated ecosystem. |
| 2 | **41 government departments with IGT tokens in one portal** | No other nation has 41 departments (PM, MFA, Justice, Health, Education, Defense, etc.) digitized with IGT symbols and services under one citizen portal. |
| 3 | **ATABEY — single command over bank, government, gaming, AI, quantum, security** | No other provider has one control plane overseeing central bank, government, casino, AI, post-quantum crypto, and security 24/7 from one dashboard. |
| 4 | **Joint Command (Fortress + AI + Quantum in one interface)** | No commercial vendor offers sovereign post-quantum crypto + AI + security (VPN, firewall, surveillance) in one sovereign stack without third-party dependency. |
| 5 | **Same KYC + same wallet for bank, casino, voting, government** | No other jurisdiction unifies identity and wallet across central banking, licensed gaming, voting, and government services in one flow. |
| 6 | **Sovereign telecom (VoIP, internet, Smart Cell, satellite)** | Own telecom stack without dependency on Meta, Google, or incumbent telcos; end-to-end sovereign communication. |
| 7 | **Post-quantum cryptography (Quantum Platform)** | Sovereign post-quantum crypto and research; not leased from a third-party vendor. |
| 8 | **Sovereign AI 24/7 (no OpenAI/Google/Anthropic)** | AI agents, support, and automation on sovereign infrastructure; no dependency on external LLM providers. |
| 9 | **SIIS (sovereign interbank settlement system)** | Own settlement and clearing; not only SWIFT; finality and liquidity within the sovereign system. |
| 10 | **CryptoHost + conversion on sovereign chain** | Node hosting, RPC, staking, and conversion (e.g. to USDT on sovereign chain) in-house; no external custody for sovereign chain. |
| 11 | **Security Fortress (Ghost Mode, VPN, firewall) — no third-party vendor** | Full security suite sovereign; no Palo Alto, Cloudflare, or AWS in the critical path. |
| 12 | **62 commercial services + 4 combos under one identity and one wallet** | No other ecosystem offers this catalog (telecom, security, AI, quantum, banking API, casino API, education, health, etc.) under one sovereign roof with one login and one wallet. |
| 13 | **Leader Control — one dashboard to open bank, government, casino, social, AI, quantum** | No other sovereign has a single entry point (PM/leadership) that opens all of these from one screen. |

**Summary:** These 13 product/capability groups are unique to the Ierahkwa sovereign stack. Competitors may have one or two similar pieces (e.g. a central bank, or a gaming platform), but **nobody has all of them together** in one sovereign ecosystem for the Americas.
