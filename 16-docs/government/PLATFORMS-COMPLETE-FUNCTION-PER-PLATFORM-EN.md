## Products and capabilities that nobody else has

These products or capabilities exist in the Ierahkwa sovereign ecosystem; **no other sovereign or commercial provider has the same combination** in one stack:

| # | Product / capability | Why nobody else has it |
|---|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **BDET Central Bank + 4 regional central banks + IGT** | No other Indigenous Americas sovereign has a full central bank, four regional central banks, and sovereign currency (IGT) issuance in one integrated ecosystem. |
| 2 | **41 government departments with IGT tokens in one portal** | No other nation has 41 departments (PM, MFA, Justice, Health, Education, Defense, etc.) digitized with IGT symbols and services under one citizen portal. |
| 3 | **ATABEY — single command over bank, government, gaming, AI, quantum, security** | No other provider has one control plane overseeing central bank, government, casino, AI, post-quantum crypto, and security 24/7 from one dashboard. |
| 4 | **Joint Command (Fortress + AI + Quantum in one interface)** | No commercial vendor offers sovereign post-quantum crypto + AI + security (VPN, firewall, surveillance) in one sovereign stack without third-party dependency. |
| 5 | **Same KYC + same wallet for bank, casino, voting, government** | No other jurisdiction unifies identity and wallet across central banking, licensed gaming, voting, and government services in one flow. |

| 9 | **SIIS (sovereign interbank settlement system)** | Own settlement and clearing; not only SWIFT; finality and liquidity within the sovereign system. |
| 10 | **CryptoHost + conversion on sovereign chain** | Node hosting, RPC, staking, and conversion (e.g. to USDT on sovereign chain) in-house; no external custody for sovereign chain. |
| 11 | **Security Fortress (Ghost Mode, VPN, firewall) — no third-party vendor** | Full security suite sovereign; no Palo Alto, Cloudflare, or AWS in the critical path. |
| 12 | **62 commercial services + 4 combos under one identity and one wallet** | No other ecosystem offers this catalog (telecom, security, AI, quantum, banking API, casino API, education, health, etc.) under one sovereign roof with one login and one wallet. |
| 13 | **Leader Control — one dashboard to open bank, government, casino, social, AI, quantum** | No other sovereign has a single entry point (PM/leadership) that opens all of these from one screen. |

**Summary:** These 13 product/capability groups are unique to the Ierahkwa sovereign stack. Competitors may have one or two similar pieces, but **nobody has all of them together** in one sovereign ecosystem for the Americas.
