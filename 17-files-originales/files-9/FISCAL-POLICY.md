# Sovereign Fiscal Policy — Ierahkwa / Red Soberana
## ZERO TAXES. Platform Revenue Funds Everything.

---

## Core Principle

**No citizen of the Ierahkwa Sovereign Nation pays taxes. Ever.**

All public services — schools, hospitals, infrastructure, security, government — are funded directly from platform transaction revenues. The platform IS the economy. The economy funds the nation.

## How It Works

### Revenue Sources (NOT taxes)
| Source | Rate | Who Pays | Annual Est. (Year 5) |
|--------|------|----------|---------------------|
| Platform transaction fees | 2-12% | Built into transactions | $89M |
| Forex conversion (WMP↔fiat) | 0.5-1% | On currency exchange | $34M |
| Premium platform tiers | Optional | Voluntary upgrade | $18M |
| Enterprise/Gov licenses | License fee | External organizations | $12M |
| Telecom subscriptions | Monthly | Voluntary service | $28M |
| **TOTAL** | — | — | **$181M** |

**Key**: These are NOT taxes. They are micro-fees on platform services that creators/workers still keep 88-95% of. Nobody files a tax return. Nobody owes the government money. The system funds itself.
