# Bill of Digital Rights
## Ierahkwa Sovereign Nation — Ratified by Consejo Digital Soberano

Every citizen of the Ierahkwa Sovereign Nation is born with these inalienable digital rights:

### Article I: Right to Zero Taxation
No citizen shall ever be required to pay taxes, fees, levies, or compulsory contributions of any kind. Public services are funded by platform revenue. This right is permanent and unamendable.

### Article II: Right to Data Sovereignty
Every citizen owns their data absolutely. No government, corporation, or entity may access, sell, share, or analyze citizen data without explicit, informed, revocable consent. Citizens may export or permanently delete all their data at any time.

### Article III: Right to Privacy
All communications, transactions, files, and personal information are encrypted with post-quantum end-to-end encryption. No backdoors exist. Not even the platform administrators can read citizen data.

### Article IV: Right to Free Education
Every citizen receives free education at all levels — preschool through university — in their indigenous language and chosen global languages. Includes free textbooks, devices, meals, tutoring, and internet access. No tuition, fees, or student debt.

### Article V: Right to Free Healthcare
Every citizen receives free healthcare — primary care, specialists, surgery, hospital stays, dental, vision, mental health, traditional medicine, prescription medicines, and emergency services. No insurance, copays, deductibles, or premiums.

### Article VI: Right to Free Infrastructure
Every citizen has access to clean water, reliable electricity, high-speed internet, maintained roads, public transportation, and safe housing. Funded by platform revenue, not citizen payments.

### Article VII: Right to Economic Sovereignty
Every citizen who creates, works, or sells on the platform keeps 88-95% of their earnings. No exploitative platform fees. No algorithmic suppression. No advertising manipulation. Fair economy, always.

### Article VIII: Right to Cultural Preservation
Every citizen has the right to communicate, learn, govern, and transact in their indigenous language. The platform must support their language. Sacred knowledge is protected by community consent protocols.

### Article IX: Right to Identity
Every citizen has a self-sovereign digital identity (Sovereign ID) that they control. No corporation or government can revoke, suspend, or manipulate their identity. Identity is verified on blockchain, not by bureaucrats.

### Article X: Right to Governance
Every citizen has an equal voice in the Consejo Digital Soberano. Every citizen can propose, debate, and vote on platform changes. All votes are recorded on blockchain — transparent, immutable, verifiable.

### Article XI: Right to Digital Tools
Every citizen has free access to all 296 sovereign platforms: email, social media, video, music, commerce, banking, healthcare, education, government, and all other services. No platform may be paywalled for basic use.

### Article XII: Right to Leave
Every citizen may leave the Ierahkwa network at any time, with all their data, with no penalty, no fee, and no delay. Sovereignty includes the freedom to leave.
