# Ierahkwa / Red Soberana — Business Plan 2026-2031

## Executive Summary
Red Soberana is the first complete sovereign digital infrastructure for indigenous peoples. 296 platforms, proprietary blockchain, central bank, 42 AI engines, satellite telecom — all built, all sovereign. Market: 72M indigenous people in the Americas, 476M globally.

## Problem
- Big Tech extracts $4.7B/year from indigenous communities (data, fees, dependency)
- 30-45% platform fees drain indigenous economies
- 14+ indigenous languages unsupported by major platforms
- Zero data sovereignty — Facebook, Google, Amazon own indigenous data
- Digital colonialism: foreign tech, foreign rules, foreign profit

## Solution
Complete digital nation infrastructure: email, social, commerce, banking, health, education, government, telecom — 296 platforms on sovereign blockchain with post-quantum encryption.
